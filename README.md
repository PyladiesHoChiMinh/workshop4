#### What is a Dictionary?

Let us take a simple to explain what Dictionary or `Dict` is

```python

python_class = {"student": ["Alice", "Bob", "Chris"]; "occupation": ["student", "marketer", "researcher"]; "Age": [20, 27, 35]}

print(python_class)
```

```python
print(python_class["student"])
print(python_class["student"][0])
```

```python
python_class["Year of Experience"] = "Less than a year"
print(python_class)
```

```python
del python_class["Year of Experience"]
print(python_class)
```

```python
for key, value in python_class.items():
  print("\n Key" + key)
  print("\n Value" + value)
```
